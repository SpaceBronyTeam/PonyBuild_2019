<tr height=50><td>4. </td><td> Metagaming </td><td>  
 You character may have a basic knowledge in the use of everyday items: first aid kits, wrench, screwdriver, etc
That is, assuming that you have a MINIMUM knowledge in most professions: botanist (to grow potatoes), medic, engineer (remove the floor, deconstruct a machine)...
 But it is possible to perform another job if it couldn't be done. If, for example, no engineers are on the station, it is possible to turn on the engine, or perform surgery without a surgeon. But if these ponies are present in the manifest, then IN ANY case this does not allow you to do the work for them.
</td><td> 
<table><tr><td>
 - A janitor performs surgery on a patient while the surgeon is present.</td></tr><tr><td>
 - A medic attempts to catch criminals, while security is already on the job.</td></tr><tr><td>
 - The clown acts as a chemist and performs all the work for him.
