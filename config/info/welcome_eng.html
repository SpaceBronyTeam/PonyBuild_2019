<br>We are glad to see you on our server, but please note that this build is in alpha testing. The build is updated regularly.<br>
Attention: Light RP rules are in effect on the server. Please familiarize yourself with them before starting the game. Ignorance of the rules is no excuse.<br>
Anyone can become a server administrator, but by their own responsibility. If you are interested please apply via Discord.<br>
<br>Note: In order for Russian characters to appear properly in the game's chat, you may need to change your computer's locale. A locale emulator can be found easily online, then simply create a shortcut to launch dreamseeker with Russian locale. This is only necessary if you wish to read the Cyrillics of other players.
